-- Create a store. Should be only 1 and we will tell it where the reducers ares
-- we will create slice.
-- we need there things to create slice. Name, Initialstate, and list of reducers
-- in slice we give list of reducers
-- in reducers we create functions
-- we get state and action in reducers
-- State: Updated state value in the store     
-- Action: Action and payload
-- export each reducer individually
-- export main source
-- re open store and give it list of reducers
-- Then whenever you have to send values use dispatch. import reducer in it
-- Use "useSelecter" to get the value. you get access of state from where you can retrieve the required value
